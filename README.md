Welcome to @Metagraphx! We've been building this NFT project organically since November 2021 and are just starting our big marketing push leading up to the Genesis Mint on June 1st. We have built up a loyal community of tech lovers and have some serious big time miners in the chat. We are currently the only #Mine-to-Earn NFT in the space. 

- Our goal is become the leading Web3 tech brand and bridge the gap between Web3 and physical tech hardware by bringing IRL PC components to our holders ⛏

Quick overview

- “Mine to earn” is a play on nft staking. Holders that stake their graphics card NFTs effectively start mining our $MGX token. These tokens will be used to enter weekly raffles of high value tech items (Fully built PCs, Next-Gen GPUs, CPUs, RAM, Laptops, ETH, and more...) or can be saved to buy specific items from our redeemable shop. We took a very long term, sustainable approach and built our ecosystem like we would a business. Essentially we have great supply chain connections, can get prices cheaper than retail and want to get the latest hardware into the hands of our tech loving community. The majority of our mint will be earning safe yield in the form of stable coins while a small portion will be used for higher risk/higher reward yielding strategies. We are conservatively projecting ~20% yield/revenue annually. This along with 50% of royalties will go directly into securing hardware for our community.
